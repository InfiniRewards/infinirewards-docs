# Development Workflow

This document outlines the workflow for developing and maintaining the InfiniRewards documentation site.

## Local Development
- Run the development server using `npm run dev`
- The site will be available at http://localhost:3000
- Changes to content files will be hot-reloaded

## Project Structure
- **src/app**: Contains the Next.js app router pages and layouts
- **src/lib**: Contains utility functions and shared components
- **.source**: Contains source configuration for documentation processing
- **content**: Contains all documentation content in MDX format

## Build Process
- The documentation is built using Next.js and Fumadocs
- Source configuration is defined in [source.config.ts](mdc:source.config.ts)
- Layout configuration is defined in [src/app/layout.config.tsx](mdc:src/app/layout.config.tsx)

## Deployment
- The site can be deployed to any platform that supports Next.js
- The build output is stored in the `.next` directory for production builds
