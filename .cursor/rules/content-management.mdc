# Content Management

Documentation content for InfiniRewards is managed through Markdown and MDX files.

## Content Location
- All documentation content is stored in [content/docs](mdc:content/docs) directory
- Raw documentation materials are stored in [raw_docs](mdc:raw_docs) directory

## Content Format
- **MDX**: The content uses MDX (Markdown with JSX) to support interactive components
- **Frontmatter**: Each content file can include frontmatter for metadata
- MDX components are configured in [src/mdx-components.tsx](mdc:src/mdx-components.tsx)

## Navigation Control
- Navigation hierarchy is defined using `meta.json` files
- The root navigation is configured in [content/docs/meta.json](mdc:content/docs/meta.json)
- Each section can have its own `meta.json` file for subsection organization
