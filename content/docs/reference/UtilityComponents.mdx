# Utility Components

InfiniRewards includes several utility components that enhance the functionality of the core contracts.

## Permission Management

The permission management system controls access to critical functions.

### Permission Types

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `OWNER` | Full control over a contract |
| `ADMIN` | Administrative functions |
| `ISSUER` | Can issue points or tokens |
| `REDEEMER` | Can redeem points or tokens |
| `MANAGER` | Can manage contract settings |

### Methods

#### Check Permission

```rust
fn check_permission(
    permission: felt252,
    user: ContractAddress,
    contract: ContractAddress
) -> bool
```

Checks if a user has a specific permission.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `permission` | `felt252` | Permission to check |
| `user` | `ContractAddress` | User address |
| `contract` | `ContractAddress` | Contract to check permission for |

Returns: Whether the user has the permission

## Session Keys

Session keys provide temporary limited permissions for specific functions.

### Session Key Structure

```rust
struct SessionKey {
    public_key: felt252,
    expiry: u64,
    permitted_calls: Array<PermittedCall>
}

struct PermittedCall {
    to: ContractAddress,
    selector: felt252,
    calldata_len_range: (u32, u32)
}
```

### Methods

#### Validate Session Transaction

```rust
fn validate_session_transaction(
    session_key_id: felt252,
    calls: Array<Call>,
    signature: Array<felt252>
) -> bool
```

Validates a transaction signed with a session key.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `session_key_id` | `felt252` | ID of the session key |
| `calls` | `Array<Call>` | Calls to validate |
| `signature` | `Array<felt252>` | Signature to verify |

Returns: Whether the transaction is valid

## Policy Enforcement

Policy enforcement implements business rules and constraints for tokens and accounts.

### Policy Types

| Policy | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `TransferPolicy` | Controls when and how tokens can be transferred |
| `RedemptionPolicy` | Rules for redeeming tokens |
| `IssuancePolicy` | Rules for issuing tokens |
| `ExpiryPolicy` | Handles token expiration rules |

### Methods

#### Check Transfer Policy

```rust
fn check_transfer_policy(
    token: ContractAddress,
    from: ContractAddress,
    to: ContractAddress,
    amount: u256
) -> bool
```

Checks if a transfer complies with the policy.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `token` | `ContractAddress` | Token contract address |
| `from` | `ContractAddress` | Sender address |
| `to` | `ContractAddress` | Recipient address |
| `amount` | `u256` | Amount to transfer |

Returns: Whether the transfer is allowed by policy
