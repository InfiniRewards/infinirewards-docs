# Merchant Onboarding Strategy

Your approach to providing predefined templates for onboarding new users and allowing them the flexibility to customize further is both user-friendly and scalable. Here's a detailed implementation strategy:

---

## 🎯 **Strategy for Merchant Onboarding & Customizable Templates**

You propose:

- Multiple industry-specific **template contracts**.
- Easy, intuitive onboarding with minimal technical expertise required.
- Flexibility for merchants to **customize logic** or **deploy as-is**.

---

## 📌 **Step 1: Define Clear Industry Verticals & Templates**

Start by clearly identifying key industries where InfiniRewards fits best:

| Vertical             | Typical Use Cases / Features               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| ☕ Cafés              | Loyalty points, stamp cards, drink redemptions |
| 🛒 E-commerce        | Cashback rewards, order tokens, vouchers    |
| 🏋️ Gyms              | Membership passes, attendance tracking      |
| 🏨 Hotels            | Points accumulation, elite status privileges|
| 🍽️ Restaurants      | Reward points, seasonal offers, gift cards |
| 🎟️ Events            | Ticketing, attendance verification, collectibles |
| 🚚 Supply Chain      | Provenance tracking, authenticity verification |
| 🏠 Real Estate       | Fractional ownership, rent management       |

---

## 📌 **Step 2: Pre-Built Smart Contract Templates**

- Each template contains predefined logic tailored specifically to each vertical.
- Clearly documented contracts for quick onboarding and customization.

Example Template Structure (Cairo 2.0):

```
templates/
├── cafes/
│   ├── CafeRewardsContract.cairo
│   └── README.md
├── ecommerce/
│   ├── EcommerceRewardsContract.cairo
│   └── README.md
├── gyms/
│   ├── GymMembershipContract.cairo
│   └── README.md
└── ...
```

**Example (Café Template)**:

```rust
#[starknet::contract]
mod CafeRewardsContract {
    use InfiniRewardsPoints;
    
    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        base: InfiniRewardsPoints::Storage,
        stamps_required: u8,
    }

    #[external]
    fn issue_stamp(customer: ContractAddress) {
        // Issue a stamp to customer
    }

    #[external]
    fn redeem_free_drink(customer: ContractAddress) {
        // Logic for redeeming a free drink after collecting stamps
    }
}
```

---

## 📌 **Step 3: User-Friendly Customization**

Merchants can choose one of two paths:

### **🔹 Option 1: Use Template As-is**

- **One-click Deployment**:
  - Merchant selects vertical → Deploys template directly.
- Minimal configuration via UI (e.g., set stamp threshold, membership durations).

### **🔸 Option 2: Custom Logic Extension**

- **Visual Builder or Code Editor**:
  - Merchants provided with intuitive UI or well-documented contract code.
- Developers or technically savvy merchants can modify or extend logic.

Example Customization Use Cases:

- **Cafés**: Custom "seasonal drinks" redemption.
- **Gyms**: Add personalized workout plan tracking.
- **E-commerce**: Add customized cashback tiers or conditional coupons.

---

## 📌 **Step 4: Web-based Merchant Portal**

Build a **Merchant Portal UI** to streamline the onboarding and customization process.

### Core Features:

- **Template Selection**:  
  Industry-specific templates clearly described.
  
- **Simple Deployment**:  
  Merchants fill forms for configuration and deploy directly.

- **Customization Interface**:  
  Simple visual editor (drag-and-drop logic builder) and advanced code-based editor for experienced developers.

- **Monitoring Dashboard**:  
  Track rewards, membership statuses, redemptions, transactions.

---

## 📌 **Step 5: Automated Deployment via InfiniRewardsFactory**

Leverage your existing Factory pattern for seamless deployment:

- **Factory Methods** (Cairo 2.0):
```rust
#[external]
fn deploy_custom_contract(template_hash: ClassHash, metadata: ByteArray) -> ContractAddress;
```

- **Easy Upgradability**:
  Users can upgrade their deployed contracts with new templates or customized logic at any time using your `upgrade` function.

---

## 📌 **Step 6: Documentation & Training Resources**

Provide comprehensive documentation and resources:

- **Getting Started Guides** (by vertical).
- **Customization Guides** clearly outlining how to safely extend logic.
- **Video Tutorials & Examples** demonstrating practical use-cases.

---

## 📌 **Step 7: Ecosystem & Marketplace**

Long-term vision:

- Allow developers to create & share custom templates.
- Marketplace for merchants to explore community-built customizations and templates.

---

## 🚩 **Benefits of this Template-based Approach**

- **Rapid Onboarding**: Merchant can deploy in minutes.
- **Reduced Barriers**: Easy adoption even without blockchain expertise.
- **Scalability**: Templates allow for efficient scaling across many industries.
- **Flexibility & Customization**: Retains merchant autonomy to adapt and evolve.

| Phase      | Action                                      | Outcome                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Phase 1 🚩 | Define clear industry templates & standards | Clear use-case templates|
| Phase 2 ⚙️ | Develop smart-contract templates & testing  | Verified templates      |
| Phase 3 🌐 | Merchant portal UI (basic)                  | Easy merchant onboarding|
| Phase 4 🔧 | Customization tools (Visual/Code editor)    | Advanced customization  |
| Phase 5 📚 | Documentation & education resources         | Merchant empowerment    |
| Phase 6 🎯 | Marketplace & community templates           | Ecosystem growth        |
