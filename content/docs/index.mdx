# InfiniRewards Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for InfiniRewards, a platform that introduces the concept of "Token with Utility" - an extension that adds programmable logic to both fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible (ERC1155) tokens.

## Key Concepts

InfiniRewards transforms tokens from simple digital assets into functional tools with specific capabilities, behaviors, and use cases embedded within them. By defining logic at the token level, we create a more flexible, extensible rewards ecosystem that empowers merchants to craft unique experiences while maintaining the standardized protocol.
