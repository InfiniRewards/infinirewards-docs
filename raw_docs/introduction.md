# InfiniRewards: Token with Utility

## Introduction

InfiniRewards introduces the concept of "Token with Utility" - an extension of the core platform that adds programmable logic to both fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible (ERC1155) tokens. This approach transforms tokens from simple digital assets into functional tools with specific capabilities, behaviors, and use cases embedded within them.

By defining logic at the token level, we create a more flexible, extensible rewards ecosystem that empowers merchants to craft unique experiences while maintaining the standardized protocol that makes InfiniRewards valuable.

## Core Concept

Each token issued through InfiniRewards can have associated utility logic that defines:

1. **Where it can be used** - Specific merchants, locations, platforms, or contexts
2. **How it can be used** - Redemption methods, transfer restrictions, time limitations
3. **What it represents** - Claim rights, membership status, access privileges, financial instruments
4. **Verification mechanisms** - How token legitimacy and ownership are validated
5. **Lifecycle management** - Issuance, expiration, redemption, and retirement rules

This utility logic is defined during token creation and stored as on-chain metadata, ensuring transparency and immutability while allowing for complex behaviors.

## Developing with StarkNet

StarkNet provides a Layer 2 scaling solution that significantly enhances the capabilities of the InfiniRewards platform through several key advantages:

### StarkNet Fundamentals

1. **Cairo Programming Language**: StarkNet uses Cairo, a Turing-complete programming language designed for creating provable programs. Cairo enables complex business logic with mathematical guarantees of correctness.

2. **STARK Proofs**: StarkNet utilizes STARK (Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge) proofs to compress thousands of transactions into a single proof, reducing gas costs while maintaining security.

3. **Account Abstraction by Default**: Unlike Ethereum's EOA model, StarkNet implements account abstraction natively, enabling powerful programmable accounts with customized validation logic.

4. **Low Transaction Costs**: By batching multiple transactions into a single proof, StarkNet dramatically reduces the per-transaction cost, making micro-transactions economically viable.

5. **Composability**: StarkNet maintains the composability of the Ethereum mainnet while scaling transaction throughput, allowing seamless interaction between different contracts and protocols.

### Leveraging Account Abstraction

InfiniRewards utilizes StarkNet's native account abstraction to create a superior user and merchant experience:

#### Current Implementation

In our current system, we maintain separate account types:
- **InfiniRewardsUserAccount**: Represents individual users/customers
- **InfiniRewardsMerchantAccount**: Represents merchant businesses

This separation allows for specialized functionality and permissions for each account type, but with StarkNet's account abstraction, we can enhance this model further.

#### Enhanced Account Capabilities

1. **Multi-call Transactions**: 
   - Users can perform multiple actions in a single transaction (e.g., claim multiple rewards from different merchants)
   - Merchants can batch-process rewards distribution to thousands of users in one transaction

2. **Session Keys**:
   - Temporary limited permissions for specific functions
   - Users can generate time-limited keys for mobile apps without exposing their main keys
   - Merchants can delegate specific administrative functions to employees with restricted permissions

3. **Gasless Transactions**:
   - Implement sponsored transactions where merchants cover gas costs for user redemptions
   - Enable meta-transactions where a third party can submit a user's signed transaction

4. **Custom Authorization Logic**:
   - Multi-signature requirements for high-value transactions
   - Time-locked transactions for scheduled rewards distribution
   - Spending limits on merchant accounts to prevent unauthorized token issuance

5. **Recovery Mechanisms**:
   - Social recovery options for lost keys
   - Tiered security with different authorization requirements based on transaction value
   - Guardian-based account recovery systems

### Application to Token Utility

Account abstraction directly enhances our Token with Utility model in several ways:

1. **Programmable Redemption Logic**:
   - Tokens can interact directly with user accounts to validate redemption conditions
   - Automatic execution of complex redemption scenarios without requiring multiple transactions

2. **Conditional Token Transfers**:
   - Tokens can enforce built-in transfer limitations based on user status, location, or time
   - Automatic validation of membership status before processing privileged transactions

3. **Batch Operations**:
   - Merchants can issue tokens to thousands of users in a single transaction
   - Users can redeem multiple tokens across different merchants in one operation

4. **Payment Flexibility**:
   - Support for payments in different tokens with automatic conversion
   - Split payments across multiple token types

5. **Access Control Abstraction**:
   - Delegate specific token management functions to third parties without compromising security
   - Enable temporary access for promotional events or limited-time offers

### Implementation Strategy

To fully leverage StarkNet's capabilities, we'll implement:

1. **Account Factories**:
   - Deploying standardized but customizable account contracts for both users and merchants
   - Supporting seamless upgrades to account logic without affecting user assets

2. **Modular Account Extensions**:
   - Optional plugins for specialized functionality (e.g., advanced recovery, multi-sig)
   - Merchant-specific modules for custom loyalty logic

3. **Account-Bound Utility Logic**:
   - Token behavior that adapts based on the capabilities of the interacting accounts
   - Account-level permissions and restrictions for token usage

4. **Cross-Contract Validation**:
   - Efficient verification of token utility parameters across contract boundaries
   - Stateless validation mechanisms that don't require storing extensive user data

5. **Scalable Batch Operations**:
   - Optimized multi-call handlers for bulk token operations
   - Efficient merkle-based verification for large-scale token distributions

## Technical Architecture

## StarkNet Account Integration Examples

To illustrate the power of account abstraction with our token utility model, consider these practical implementations:

### Example 1: Time-Limited Promotional Tokens

**Implementation:**
```cairo
// Simplified example of time-limited promotional token validation
@external
func redeem_promotional_token(
    token_id: u256, 
    amount: u256, 
    promotion_id: felt252
) {
    // Verify the token is a valid promotion token
    let (is_promo) = collectible_contract.is_promotion_token(token_id);
    assert is_promo = TRUE;
    
    // Check if promotion is still active
    let (start_time, end_time) = promotions.get_timeframe(promotion_id);
    let (current_time) = get_block_timestamp();
    assert current_time >= start_time;
    assert current_time <= end_time;
    
    // Use account abstraction to verify user eligibility without additional signature
    let (caller) = get_caller_address();
    let (user_eligible) = user_accounts.is_eligible_for_promotion(caller, promotion_id);
    assert user_eligible = TRUE;
    
    // Process the redemption in a single atomic transaction
    collectible_contract.burn(caller, token_id, amount);
    promotions.record_redemption(caller, promotion_id, amount);
    rewards.credit_promotion_reward(caller, promotion_id, amount);
}
```

### Example 2: Merchant-Sponsored Transaction

**Implementation:**
```cairo
// Merchant covering gas fees for user redemptions
@external
func redeem_with_sponsored_gas(
    user: ContractAddress,
    token_id: u256,
    redemption_signature: (felt252, felt252),
    merchant_signature: (felt252, felt252)
) {
    // Verify the user signed this redemption request
    let message_hash = hash_redemption_request(user, token_id);
    let is_valid_user_sig = verify_signature(user, message_hash, redemption_signature);
    assert is_valid_user_sig = TRUE;
    
    // Verify the merchant is sponsoring this transaction
    let merchant = get_token_merchant(token_id);
    let sponsorship_message = hash_sponsorship_request(user, token_id);
    let is_valid_merchant_sig = verify_signature(merchant, sponsorship_message, merchant_signature);
    assert is_valid_merchant_sig = TRUE;
    
    // Process the redemption with the merchant covering gas costs
    collectible_contract.redeem(user, token_id, 1);
}
```

    token_id: u256,
    session_key: felt252,
    expiry: u64,
    allowed_steps: Span<felt252>
) {
    // Get the caller (user account)
    let (caller) = get_caller_address();
    
    // Register a temporary session key with limited permissions
    user_accounts.register_session_key(
        caller,
        session_key,
        expiry,
        allowed_steps
    );

    session_key_signature: (felt252, felt252)
) {
    // Retrieve redemption details
    let (user, token_id, session_key) = redemption_processor.get_redemption_details(redemption_id);
    
    // Verify the session key signature
    let message_hash = hash_step_execution(redemption_id, step_id);
    let is_valid_sig = verify_session_signature(session_key, message_hash, session_key_signature);
    assert is_valid_sig = TRUE;
    
    // Verify session key is authorized for this step
    let is_authorized = user_accounts.is_step_authorized(user, session_key, step_id);
    assert is_authorized = TRUE;
    
    // Execute the redemption step
    redemption_processor.execute_step(redemption_id, step_id);
